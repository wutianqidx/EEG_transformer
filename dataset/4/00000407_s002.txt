CLINICAL HISTORY:   58 year old right handed gentleman with a long history of epilepsy, currently seizures down to 1 every 3 months.  Previous left central focus during EEG monitoring.  Cerebellar atrophy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Both drowsiness and hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.  Vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep.  There are minor asymmetries as well as artifact noted in the T3 electrode.  These are apparent in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy and/or transitioning in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  There is no significant driving response.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted in this record.  Comparison with this patient's previous EEGs prior to 2002 as well as the 2009 and
2003 EEG can be considered, but the records in the Temple database appear to have been normal studies.
