History:	38 year old man with a history of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.
Medications:	lamictal, zonisamide, seroquel
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low amplitude theta
activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.  Drowsiness is characterized by decrease in diffuse
Frequent high amplitude generalized 1-2 Hz spikes with aftergoing slow waves and polyspikes with
aftergoing slow waves are seen.  Occasionally, isolated right hemispheric spikes with aftergoing
slow waves are captured.  Brief bursts of generalized frontally predominant paroxysmal fast activity
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow
Polyspike-and-wave complexes
Other, GPFA (generalized paroxysmal fast activity)
Spike-and-wave complexes, right hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, slow
generalized and independent right hemispheric spike and wave and polyspike and wave discharges
and GPFA (generalized paroxysmal fast activity). These findings indicate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction and diffuse cortical irritability and, in the proper clinical context, are suggestive of
