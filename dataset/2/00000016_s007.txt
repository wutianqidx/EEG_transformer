History:	28 YR OLD FEMALE WITH STATUS ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES.
Medications:	ATIVAN 2MG IV PUSH, LAMICTAL, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by at best a 7HZ alpha rhythm.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal spikes are present with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at C3/P3. At times in 1Hz bursts for seconds.  Multiple O2 electrographic seizures
occurring for ~3 minutes. The appear to remain posteriorly with minimal spread. There is no
clinical correlate. They begin with spiky theta discharged minimally spreads centrally.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, frequent, right posterior
